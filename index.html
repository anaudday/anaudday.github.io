<p class="center">Audrey Dayrit is a digital media and illustration artist with an interest in web design, game design, and digital drawing. Much of her work is inspired around anime culture, concept art, popular internet trends, and various aspects of video game culture, from character designs to game creation.</p>

  <p style= "font-size: 21px; text-indent: 40px; margin: auto; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 30px; width: 80%">My aim as an artist is to create art simply for the enjoyment and entertainment of others! I find the fun especially in creating narrative pieces with interesting and attractive characters that my audience can come to love. I believe that every now and than, people need a break from their serious and busy lives to appreciate more recreational activities from the comfort of their home. One of my intentions as an artist is to create interactive pieces that can be enjoyed conveniently from their own devices, such as a laptop, smart device, or home computer.</p>
  <p style= "font-size: 21px; text-indent: 40px; margin: auto; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; width: 80%">Although much of my interests lie in illustration and concept art, I also expand my range in mediums as a digital media artist. By incorporating the field of digital media art, with a focus on web design and game design, I can enhance my illustrations and concepts by presenting them with more technological means &mdash; for example, through a narrative website by using Javascript or in a video game. In my future, I can see myself contributing towards character and game concepts to a collaborative project with the goal of creating a brand-new video game.</p>
