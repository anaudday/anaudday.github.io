<p class="center">Audrey Dayrit is a digital media and illustration artist with an interest in web design, game design, and digital drawing. Much of her work is inspired around anime culture, concept art, popular internet trends, and various aspects of video game culture, from character designing to narrative building.</p>

<div class= "center2" style= "background-color: white; border-radius: 10px">
  <h2 style= "padding-top: 14px">ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
  <p style= "font-size: 21px; text-indent: 40px; margin: auto; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 30px; width: 80%">My aim as an artist is to create art simply for the enjoyment and entertainment of others. I find the fun especially in creating narrative pieces with interesting and attractive characters that my audience can come to love. As a child, I always loved watching cartoons and playing games. In doing so, I would notice how much it positively affected my life and interests as I grew older. Many people may think that doing such activities, especially as an adult, is a waste of time or makes you seem childish. But for me, that is not the case; I have seen the positives in viewing such eye-catching animations made for recreational purposes — from meeting peers with similar interests, expanding my circles, and simply sharing moments of amusement while indulging in anime and video games, to truly realizing what my passions are and firmly coming to terms with what I want to pursue as an artist. In a way, my art is a statement of myself and who I am as a person — a person who enjoys seeing others happy and amused; a person who aims to create contemporary works that can be interactively and/or visually enjoyed by others.</p>
  <p style= "font-size: 21px; text-indent: 40px; margin: auto; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 30px; width: 80%">Most artists may ask themselves, “Why do I make art?” There are many answers to this question, such as “to spread awareness”, “to make a statement”, or “to represent myself”. I strongly resonate with the idea of making art that represents not only myself, but also what I believe represents the happiness of others who enjoy modern culture and its evolving trends. I realize that my art style most commonly appeals to the interests of those ranging from teens to young and mid-age adults who follow along with ongoing trends. Even if my work may only  appeal to a certain audience, my purpose and intentions as an artist stay the same, so long as my viewers can enjoy what I’ve made.</p>
  <p style= "font-size: 21px; text-indent: 40px; margin: auto; margin-top: -15px; margin-bottom: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px; width: 80%">Although much of my interests lie in illustration and concept art, I also expand my range in mediums as a digital media artist. I feel that I can most potently execute and show off my skills of creating character concepts through illustration, specifically digital illustration. But as of this year, I have been more and more accustomed with tools of designing on the web (HTML, CSS, Javascript), as well as programs and class projects that increase my appeal towards game creation, and I have been taking a great interest in both. And so, since the beginning of the Spring 2021 semester, I have been focusing more on practicing web design and game design, as I feel that I can reach further heights by learning these new skills and combining it with the illustrations that I continue to make today. By incorporating the field of digital media art, with a focus on web and game design, I can enhance my illustrations and concepts by presenting them with more technological means — for example, through a narrative website by using Javascript or in a video game. In my future, I can see myself doing something like contributing towards character and game concepts to a collaborative project with the goal of creating a brand-new video game.</p>
