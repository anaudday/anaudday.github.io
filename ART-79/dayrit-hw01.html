  <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Audrey Dayrit</b> is an artist-in-practice with a focus on web design, game design, and digital art. She enjoys playing games and -- as a result -- takes an interest in concept art and game design, from drawing out a diversity of interesting characters to creating interesting video game paths and elements.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px">She currently attends San Jose State University while taking summer classes at San Jose City College. She plans to graduate from SJSU in Fall 2022 with a BFA in Digital Media Art.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #5040ae; font-size: 30px">What she's been playing recently:</h2>

      <li>Deep Rock Galactic
        <ul>
          <li style="font-size: 15px">Co-op first-person shooter (FPS); travel across a diverse variety of biomes as a dwarf to mine precious minerals, complete arduous tasks, and fight against weird alien bugs. Basically a rogue-like Minecraft that focuses more on action over creativity and building. "For rock and stone!"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Minecraft</li>
        <ul>
         <li style="font-size: 15px">Peaceful yet adventurous first-person builder that welcomes all creative ideas and allows you to build almost anything out of blocks.</li>

        <ul>
          <li style="font-size: 15px">Pixel-graphic rogue-like game that follows the story of a merchant, who is also the last Moonlighter(?). Search through randomly-generated rooms for treasure and materials while fighting monsters, then make profit at your shop by selling the things you find to other travelers. (I haven't played the game enough to give it an accurate description.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
